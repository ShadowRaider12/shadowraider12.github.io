## Hi, I'm Kwabena
I’m a student developer interested in robotics, computer vision, and practical engineering projects. I enjoy building things that actually work — from Raspberry Pi robots to face-recognition access systems and small game prototypes.

### What I work with
- Python  
- C# / Unity (Deadzone: Nexus – early development)  
- Git & GitHub (daily use for school and WRO robotics work)  

### Projects
- WRO Future Engineers 2025 – Autonomous robot powered by a Raspberry Pi 5  
- Face Recognition System – Photo-based access control project  
- Deadzone v1 – A simple Unity game prototype  
- School science and CS work – Clean, organised repos following IGCSE standards
- RaiderLLM - A tiny LLM built with Python

### Goals
- Build a fully autonomous obstacle-navigation robot  
- Improve clean coding, documentation, and version control  
- Prepare for IGCSE exams in May
